# festival.jl

A rather horrible idea I had one evening and couldn't resist coding up. This
module turns sawfish into a talking window manager (you'll need a copy of
[festival](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/) installed). Download
`festival.jl` and annoy everyone within earshot of your workstation.
